## Documentation
This is a week-long project built in my spare time. The goals of the project included reinforcement
The use of asynchronous operations using an external API that I did not know before that during its research was exposed to its vast breadth.
The part I enjoyed the most was the auto-complete input bar, I built it from scratch and the combination with React states was challenging but satisfying and instructive.
This is a Full Mern-Stack side to side (mongoDB, ExpressJS , React , NodeJS).
